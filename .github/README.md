Nebula is a minimalistic and easy to use administration tool for Laravel applications, made with Laravel, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.

Nebula makes you write less code and lets you focus more on the product by lessening the code required to build CRUD interfaces and metrics. Nebula offers a rich CLI and a set of metrics and form fields that does the heavy lifting for you.

**This is the pre 1.0.0 version, the API might be subject to change. Please be careful with using this version in production apps.**
